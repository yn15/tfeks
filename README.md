## Terraform EKS workshop code

This code repo is intended to be used with the public AWS workshop:

https://tf-eks-workshop.workshop.aws/


The intent is to build a private EKS cluster with some sample application just using Terraform (no "eksctl" !).

The workshop also does not (deliberately) use any of the available Terraform modules for VPC's or EKS. The idea being you can take this code into your own module structure as you see fit.

Much of the workshops Terraform code was originally created by the author's (awsandy) other notable tool:
